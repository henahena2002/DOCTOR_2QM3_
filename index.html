I've never known someone like you<br>
Tangled in love, stuck by you from the glue<br>
Don't forget to kiss me or else you'll have to miss me<br>
I guess I'm stuck forever by the glue, oh, and you<br>
      <br> 
You've been hiding in plain sight, and it appeared, oh I know<br>
Loving you once only feels wrong, I need you<br>
I always knew I'd find you, to be here is worth the wait to<br>
I'm not lying when I say, "I've been stuck by the glue onto you"<br>
<br>
I've been stuck by glue<br>
Right onto you<br>
I've been stuck by glue<br>
      <br>
I've never known<br>
I've never known someone like you<br>
I've never known<br>
I've never known someone like you<br>
